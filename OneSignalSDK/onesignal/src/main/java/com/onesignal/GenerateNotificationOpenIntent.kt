     * Creates a PendingIntent to attach to the notification click and it's action button(s).
     * If the user interacts with the notification this normally starts the app or resumes it
     * unless the app developer disables this via a OneSignal meta-data AndroidManifest.xml setting
     *
     * The default behavior is to open the app in the same way an Android homescreen launcher does.
     * This means we expect the following behavior:
     * 1. Starts the Activity defined in the app's AndroidManifest.xml as "android.intent.action.MAIN"
     * 2. If the app is already running, instead the last activity will be resumed
     * 3. If the app is not running (due to being push out of memory), the last activity will be resumed
     * 4. If the app is no longer in the recent apps list, it is not resumed, same as #1 above.
     * - App is removed from the recent app's list if it is swiped away or "clear all" is pressed.
